**A* Pathfinding Adventure: A Visual Guide to Heuristics**

Welcome to this interactive exploration of the A* (A-Star) search algorithm! This project is designed for beginners to see, with their own eyes, how A* finds the shortest path in a maze and how its performance changes based on the "heuristic" or guessing strategy it uses.

We will implement A* from scratch and run three experiments to test:

A perfect heuristic.
A non-admissible (pessimistic) heuristic.
An inconsistent (unreliable) heuristic.

Let's dive in!

**what is A* Search, Anyway?**
Imagine you need to get from your home (start) to a friend's house (goal) in a city with lots of streets and buildings. How would you find the shortest route? You wouldn't just wander randomly. You'd probably use a map and try to head in the general direction of your friend's house.

A* works just like that! For every possible step it can take, it calculates a score called the f-score. The path with the lowest f-score is explored first.

The score is calculated with a simple formula:

```
f(n) = g(n) + h(n)
```
Where:
- `n` is the next possible square (or "node") on the path.
- `g(n)` is the actual cost of the path from the start to this square `n`. (Think of it as the distance you've already traveled).
- `h(n)` is the heuristic or estimated cost from the square `n` to the goal. (This is our "smart guess" of the remaining distance).

The magic of A* lies in the h(n) part—the heuristic. Let's look at what makes a heuristic good or bad.

**The Brain of A*: Understanding Heuristics**

A heuristic is just a function that helps A* make smart decisions. But for A* to work perfectly, its heuristic must follow two important rules.

**1. Admissible Heuristic (The Optimist )**
An admissible heuristic is always optimistic. It **never overestimates** the actual cost to get to the goal. This property is crucial because it guarantees that A* will find the shortest path.

The Rule: The guessed cost must be less than or equal to the real cost.
```
h(n) ≤ true_cost(n)
```

Think of it this way: If the goal is 10 steps away, an admissible heuristic might guess it's 8 steps away, or 10, but it will never guess it's 11 steps away. This optimism is key to finding the shortest path.

**2. Consistent Heuristic (The Logical Guide )**
A consistent heuristic follows the "triangle inequality." It means that as you move from one square to a neighbor, the heuristic cost shouldn't drop by more than the cost of that single step.

The Rule: For any node `current` and its neighbor `neighbor`:
```
h(current) ≤ cost(current, neighbor) + h(neighbor)
```

This makes the search logical and efficient. It prevents the algorithm from getting confused by wild jumps in its own estimates.

> **Note:** A consistent heuristic is always admissible. However, an admissible heuristic is not always consistent.
